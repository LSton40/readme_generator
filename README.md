## Description  
    
Using Node.js with the Inquirer NPM (v8.2.4) and some starter code, the goal of this project was to develop a command line application that would generate a polished README.md file using appropriate markdown notation. The app issues prompts for user input where they might enter the title of their project, their name, GitHub username, email, copyright year, and their own personalized text for the project Description, Installation instructions, Usage directions, instructions on how other users might contribute to the project, and tests that might be run through their project application to demonstrate functionality. The user is also given a list prompt to select a license for their project. Based on the user input, a README is generated that includes section headers, the user created text, a hyperlink functional Table of Contents, a license badge appropriate to the license that they selected as well as a link to the lincense page. Their contact information, including GitHub username, a link to their GitHub page, and email is added under a section entitled Questions, with a prompt to contact them at the given email if anyone has questions regarding the project. Their name and the copyright year is also included in a generic copyright statement under the License section.
